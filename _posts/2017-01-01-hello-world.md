Hi! This is a placeholder post till I figure out how to play with this Jekyll theme to include a display picture.

I've never been much of a blogger, with [Twitter](https://twitter.com/xrinivasan) being my primary 'thought-dump' occasionally. But, with a few of my personal/forked Data Science and Visualization projects lying around in random files, I decided to make a small corner for myself. This is also my attempt to get back into Markdown.
