title: Did You Read?
---

Thanks to Twitter and a slew of newsletters that I have signed up for over the years, my [Instapaper](https://instapaper.com) account has been burgeoning like a First-World nation's deficit.

Given that the rate of bookmarking is always less than the rate of reading, I'm sure I'm losing some gems in this [LIFO inventory](https://www.thebalance.com/lifo-last-in-first-out-inventory-cost-method-398323). As I see it, there are a couple of things I can do :

- Let it go : Treat my bookmarks as 'missed connections' that would only deserve reminiscing on lonely nights without internet
- Power through : Break all social contacts, lock myself up in a room, and emerge in a year having archived all my posts, only to realise that I now have a year of unread material and unreal FOMO
- Build my own weekly : Create a personalised searchable index and recommendation engine based on ALL my bookmarks. EVER. 

Brass Tacks : Use a Instapaper API wrapper to access my bookmarks, build corpus, build index and recommendation engine, bask in Inbox Zero glory of my account, and hopefully cross the street carefully.

Will update post as I progress.
