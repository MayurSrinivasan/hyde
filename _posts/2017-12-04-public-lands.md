I never envisioned this to be (even a) semi-political blog, but if Constable Frozen can be horny on main...

...then I can certainly talk about the sweeping reduction in protected lands that was signed today for two national monuments in Utah.

Apart from the ecological, archaeological, and historical need for protection, this move is a complete disregard of the cultural impacts to Native American tribes, who, sadly, have long lost a seat at the negotiating table. Utah can't take 3 years to make a bill, and then cry 'over-reach!' on a subject that can quickly devolve into the molestation of all that is dear to us.

I hope this act is overturned. At the very least, it brought many [conservacy groups] (http://www.patagonia.com/protect-public-lands.html) to the fore.
